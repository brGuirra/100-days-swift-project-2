## 💁🏽‍♂️ Overview

This app is a guess the flag game

## ⚙️ How it works

The app shows a countrie name and three flags. The user has to 
tap on the flag that matches the countrie's name

If is correct the user gains a point, if isn't they lose a point

The score is updated at each round and in the end the user sees
the final score and can play again
